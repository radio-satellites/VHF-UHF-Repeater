## 10/28/2025 - Working principles  

Thinking about exactly how this can work, and what parts to use!

Goals:

- Repeat VHF to UHF FM signals
- Be configurable to different frequencies, power levels, etc.
- Identify itself on the air with morse 
- Have a maximum transmission limit of ~15 seconds to prevent overheating

I'm planning to use a DRA818V module for receiving and a DRA818U module for transmitting. Each will be configured via UART to set frequencies, CTCSS, etc. I might also add a GPS receiver on board to transmit it's location once in a while. 

I also need to think about the type of microcontroller to use. I'm leaning towards an STM8, but I've never worked with STM8s before and only a bit with STM32s. STM8s are less pricy but also appear less well supported. Either way, my only requirements are having 3x UARTs and about 10 GPIO pins. Maybe an STM32 will be better. 

In terms of PA, maybe it's worth reverse engineering the DRA818 module? Need to think about this
